Systematic walk of every feature and function toward QA-ready state. 
Running log. Each entry: what we looked at, what we found, what we

## Area 1 — Billing

Walked and largely fixed during the 18-19 April 2026 billing coherence 
session. See git tag `billing-v1.0` for the milestone commit.

### What was looked at

Full invariant walk of the billing system:

- Ledger identity (payments − refunds = paid_minor)
- Overpayment behaviour (manual vs Stripe paths)
- Invoice state machine (draft / sent / overdue / paid / void transitions)
- Installment state machine including A3 partially_paid
- Refund behaviour (A4 paid→sent on refund, void composability)
- Void guard (A5 blocks void on partially-paid)
- Parent dashboard outstanding math (A6 invoice-level)
- Closure date exclusion in billing runs
- Rate snapshot immutability at booking time
- Single source of truth for outstanding across 4 parent-facing surfaces
- Idempotency across 4 reminder/auto-pay edge functions

### What was found and fixed

- **Fix 1+4** — new `record_manual_payment` RPC with overpayment hard-reject. 
  Replaces client-side direct INSERTs. New `invoices.overpayment_minor` 
  column captures Stripe overpayment race cases (Stripe charge completes 
  before any guard could fire — ledger must match reality, so accept and 
  flag rather than reject). `recalculate_invoice_paid` now populates 
  `overpayment_minor` on every recalc.
- **Due-date-aware refund reopen** — when a refund reopens a paid invoice 
  whose due date is past, status goes direct to `overdue` rather than 
  `sent`. Applied at all three paid→sent transition sites 
  (`record_stripe_payment` idempotent and main paths + `recalculate_invoice_paid`).
- **Fix 2 (B28)** — `void_invoice` clears `billing_run_id` and defensively 
  voids `partially_paid` installments.
- **Cluster B+ cleanup** — 25 test invoices wiped (15 phantom `paid_minor`, 
  4 voided-with-unrefunded-payments, 6 ledger-stale paid invoices). Zero 
  real customers at time of wipe. Ledger identity confirmed holds across 
  all 345 remaining invoices.
- **Frontend swap** — `RecordPaymentModal` / `useRecordPayment` now calls 
  `record_manual_payment` RPC. Client-side overpayment-confirm UX removed 
  as dead code. Server-side error refocuses amount input for in-place 
  correction.
- **Fix 5a** — `auto-pay-upcoming-reminder` edge function gained 
  same-day dedup via `message_log` + `related_id` grain corrected from 
  `invoice_id` to `installment_id`. Protects against cron re-fire 
  duplicate sends.

### What was found but not fixed yet

- **Tracked — triple reimplementation of per-installment outstanding** 
  (`useInstallmentOutstanding`, `useParentInstallments`, 
  `overdue-reminders`). Currently agree; could drift. Consolidate 
  with a `get_installment_outstanding` RPC. Low priority.
- **Deferred — 27 Bucket B items** from the 17 April audit queue 
  (`BILLING_FIXES_QUEUE.md`). Some wait for C32 family accounts, 
  most are small and should land during the systematic polish pass.
- **Deferred — C50 entity_type plural/singular inconsistency** in 
  audit_log across RPCs and triggers. One consolidation migration.
- **Deferred — C51 audit trigger gap** — 10 billing-adjacent tables 
  (refunds, installments, closures, guardians, etc.) without audit 
  triggers. One consolidation migration.
- **Deferred — Xero fire-and-forget reliability** (original Section 
  3d A3). `accounting.payments` scope live since 17 April but the 
  `xero-sync-payment` edge function is still a no-op. Session 2 
  deliverable or sooner.
- **Pre-existing — `'cancelled'` status references in RPC bodies**. 
  Enum has no `cancelled` value but RPCs defensively reference it. 
  Dead branches. Either add the value or remove the references. 
  Not urgent.

### Invariants verified

See `BILLING_PRODUCTION_READY.md` (to be written) for the full 
invariant register. Summary:

- I1 Ledger identity: holds across all 345 invoices (post Cluster B+ wipe).
- I2 Overpayment bounds: manual path hard-rejects; Stripe path accepts 
  and flags via `overpayment_minor`. Both behaviours intentional and 
  documented.
- I3 Installment sum identity: holds.
- I4 No stranded money: A5 guard prevents creation of new cases; 
  pre-A5 cases cleaned up in Cluster B+ wipe.
- I5 Refund bound: `record_manual_refund` caps at per-payment refundable.
- I6 Invoice status reflects state: holds with new due-date-aware branch.
- I7 Installment status reflects state: A3 three-band logic holds.
- I8 Billing run integrity: B28 fix clears `billing_run_id` on void. 
  Holds.
- I10 Rate snapshot immutability: holds (confirm_makeup_booking 4-level 
  priority chain).
- I11 Closure exclusion: `create-billing-run` consults `closure_dates`.
- I13 Idempotency keys: Stripe path idempotent on provider_reference. 
  All 4 reminder/auto-pay edge functions verified (5a fix closed last gap).
- I16 Single source of truth for outstanding: 4 parent-facing surfaces 
  consume same corrected state.
- I17 Transaction atomicity: `record_manual_payment`, `record_manual_refund`, 
  `record_stripe_payment` all atomic-single-txn.
- I19 Void/refund/cancel composability: `record_manual_refund` rejects 
  void; A5 blocks partial-paid void; `record_stripe_payment` skips void.

### Invariants still to be verified

- I9 Xero sync state — deferred with Xero reliability work
- I12 Audit trail completeness — deferred with C51
- I14/I15 RLS scoping (parent / teacher) — to be walked in Area 9
- I18 Notification consistency — partial, finish in Area 10
- I20 Timezone consistency — separate pass
