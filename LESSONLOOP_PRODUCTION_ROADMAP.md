# LessonLoop Production Roadmap

**Goal:** Take LessonLoop from current state to genuinely production-ready across every feature surface. No compromises, no lighter-touch options. Every flow walked end-to-end, every bug fixed, every cohesion gap closed, every invariant verified.

**Started:** 21 April 2026  
**Current customers:** 0 (target: aggressive customer acquisition begins once all areas close)  
**Estimated duration:** 14-18 weeks at current pace. This is a larger scope than originally scoped — see Scale section below.  
**Methodology:** Per-area inventory → per-journey deep-dive walk → numbered findings → product decisions → committed fixes with hashes → filed items for later passes → update roadmap status.

## 🚦 Resuming this work

If you are a Claude session inheriting this work, or Jamie is picking up after a break, do these in order:

1. **Read this file end-to-end.** It tells you which area and journey is in flight, what's closed, what's filed.
2. **Read `POLISH_NOTES.md`** — captures the play-by-play of every commit, every finding, every decision rationale, and every filed item with full context.
3. **Run `git log --oneline -30`** — see recent commits that got us here.
4. **Use `conversation_search`** for "LessonLoop journey" or specific area/journey references — recovers conversation-level decision context that may not have made it into files.
5. **Confirm with Jamie** which area/journey to resume before starting work.

**Working principles — Jamie's defaults (memory-stored):**
- Do everything properly. Fix everything. No compromises. No lighter-touch options.
- When asked to scope, default answer is "everything."
- Always design the proper solution first; never propose lighter-touch alternatives.
- Direct-to-main commits (no feature branches).
- Always provide ready-to-paste Lovable prompts for edge function deploys / verification.
- Same Claude Code window throughout an area.
- Verify state first (`git log -1 --oneline`), end with `git push`.
- Never suggest breaks, sleep, pacing, or "another day."

**Standard workflow per journey:**
1. Inventory files involved (Lovable or Claude Code pastes relevant files verbatim)
2. Walk end-to-end, surface numbered findings (Jn-F1, Jn-F2, …)
3. Triage: real bugs, cohesion gaps, product decisions, filed-for-later
4. Call out product decisions with recommended answer (Jamie says "everything")
5. Write commits with full edit specifications
6. Deploy via Lovable (edge functions / migrations) where relevant
7. Update POLISH_NOTES.md (Fixed / Filed) + this file (mark journey closed)

**Workflow stack:**
- **Claude (this assistant)** — planning, finding analysis, edit specifications, decision framing
- **Claude Code web** — repo file edits, typecheck, commits, pushes
- **Lovable** — Supabase migrations apply, edge function deploys, live RPC verification
- **GitHub web** — tag creation, branch protection workarounds

**Status legend:** ⚪ Not started · 🟡 In progress · 🟢 Closed · 🔴 Blocked · 🟠 Has known production blocker

**Total scoped journeys across all areas:** ~168 (Journey 11 added during J4 walk).

---

## Area 0 — Cross-cutting invariants ⚪

These are system-wide concerns that touch multiple areas. They run in parallel with the per-area work and have their own closure criteria.

### Track 0.1 — Audit log completeness 🟠 PRODUCTION BLOCKER

**Problem (discovered 21 April 2026):** 14 of 19 business-critical tables have NO audit trigger. Money-adjacent surfaces (`refunds`, `make_up_credits`, `term_adjustments`, `invoice_installments`, `invoice_items`, `billing_runs`, `rate_cards`, `teacher_profiles`, `profiles`, `guardians`, `lesson_participants`, `student_guardians`, `terms`) leave no trail for out-of-band edits. RPCs manually insert `audit_log` rows but any service-role or RLS-bypass modification goes unrecorded.

**Scope:** Add audit triggers for all remaining business-critical tables. Normalise `audit_log.entity_type` casing (currently mixed singular/plural — C50 flagged in POLISH_NOTES but deferred). Add column-level before/after snapshots for the most sensitive columns (money fields, role fields).

**Why a track, not a journey:** touches every area. Must close before any area can be marked "audit-complete."

### Track 0.2 — RLS uniformity walk ⚪

**Problem:** 518 policies across 82 tables. March 2026 migration cluster (15 days, 30+ fix migrations) suggests pressure. Jamie's memory notes a Klarvo lesson where DELETE/INSERT/UPDATE privileges were accidentally revoked — same risk class here.

**Scope:** Systematic walk of RLS policies per table. Verify every operation for every role is covered. Confirm no table has contradictory or overlapping policies. Document the final matrix (role × table × operation) so regressions are detectable.

### Track 0.3 — Timezone consistency ⚪

**Problem:** Various parts of the code use `new Date()` (UTC) directly versus `toLocaleDateString("en-CA", { timeZone: tz })` (org-local). Billing run edge function was recently fixed to use org timezone for due-date calculation — pattern is correct there but likely not applied everywhere.

**Scope:** Grep-based walk of `new Date()` usage across `src/` and `supabase/functions/`. Flag every location that computes dates for business logic (due dates, attendance cutoffs, reminder cadence, closure exclusion, lesson scheduling). Normalise to org timezone.

### Track 0.4 — Notification consistency ⚪

**Problem:** Push notifications only wired to lesson reminders. Email reminder cadence defined per-type but consistency not verified. Internal notifications and parent-facing notifications use different tables (`internal_messages` vs `message_log` vs `notification_preferences`).

**Scope:** Inventory every notification trigger point. Map channels (email, push, in-app). Identify gaps (invoice sent ≠ push notification today). Normalise recipient-preference checks.

### Track 0.6 — Cron schedule reconciliation (known BILLING_FORENSICS territory) 🟠

**Problem:** Audit on 24 April 2026 found 7 of 8 documented reminder / expiry / auto-pay crons deviate from `docs/CRON_JOBS.md` expected schedule:

- `overdue-reminders` — MISSING until 24 April 2026 (fixed, scheduled `0 9 * * *` UTC, jobid 16). J7 was not production-live for the 6-hour window between J7 close and this fix.
- `auto-pay-upcoming-reminder` — MISSING. Expected `0 8 * * *`. Guardians do not receive the 3-day pre-due auto-pay notice email.
- `stripe-auto-pay-installment` — MISSING. Expected `0 9 * * *`. **High impact — silent feature loss:** no auto-pay ever fires. Guardians who enabled auto-pay in-app never get charged; installments fall overdue despite stored default payment method.
- `credit-expiry` — MISSING. Expected `0 2 * * *`. **Structural break:** warnings fire but credits never actually expire. Parents receive "expires in 3 days" emails about credits that silently stay usable past their `expires_at` date.
- `credit-expiry-warning-daily` — wrong schedule: `0 8 * * *` (expected `55 1 * * *`). Moot until `credit-expiry` is scheduled; then needs re-ordering to run first.
- `invoice-overdue-check` — wrong schedule: `30 5 * * *` (expected `0 2 * * *`). May be intentional.
- `installment-overdue-check` — wrong schedule: `0 6 * * *` (expected `0 2 * * *`). May be intentional.
- `installment-upcoming-reminder` — MATCH at `0 8 * * *`.

**Scope:** full audit walk — for each missing/wrong schedule, determine (a) when the gap opened via commit history, (b) impact on users / features shipped, (c) whether time mismatches are intentional or drift, (d) the reconciliation plan. Mirror BILLING_FORENSICS methodology: walk → report → triage → batch-fix.

**Priority:** high. Three shipped features (auto-pay charges, credit expiry cascade, overdue dunning until 24 April) confirmed silently non-functional in production.

### Track 0.7 — Operator manual-trigger UI for cron functions ⚪

**Problem:** Cron reconciliation (Track 0.6), backfill operations, and debug-a-broken-cron workflows all require operator intervention via Supabase Dashboard. No in-app surface. A future cron-gap or schedule drift means operator has to leave the app, authenticate to Supabase, find the right edge-function invoke button.

**Scope:** small admin-only surface (settings tab or audit page) listing every cron edge function with a "Run now" button, rate-limited per-function, writes to `audit_log` with actor. Companion feature for Track 0.6 ongoing health monitoring. Low priority individually but compounds with every future cron gap.

---

## Area 1 — Billing & invoicing 🟡

**Status:** In progress. Journey 9 Phase 4A complete (recurring billing fully usable end-to-end via UI; landed 25 April 2026). Phase 4B operator UX polish optional next step.

**Files in scope:** `src/pages/Invoices.tsx`, `src/pages/InvoiceDetail.tsx`, `src/components/invoices/*` (16 files), `src/hooks/useInvoices.ts`, `src/hooks/useBillingRuns.ts`, billing-related edge functions (16), related migrations.

### Journey 1 — Create / edit invoice 🟢 CLOSED

**Walked:** 21 April 2026  
**Findings:** 21 (F1-F21) · **Fixed:** 14 across 4 commits · **Filed:** 7  
**Key commits:** `538fd7a` · `2d5bfe6` · `546abc2` (RPC) · `5710952` (UI)  
**Notable:** Lovable autonomously fixed two bugs in our `update_invoice_with_items` migration. Process improvement logged: read analogous existing RPC end-to-end before writing new ones.

### Journey 2 — Billing run wizard 🟢 CLOSED

**Walked:** 21 April 2026  
**Findings:** 20 (BR1-BR20) · **Fixed:** 10 across 3 commits · **Filed:** 10  
**Key commits:** `e53eebc` · `5c022cf` · `f2eca70`  
**Notable:** Edge function rewritten from batch INSERTs to per-payer `create_invoice_with_items` RPC. `is_org_active` enforced. Xero sync attempts now tracked in `xero_entity_mappings`. Stricter `delete_billing_run`. Btree_gist-backed overlap exclusion constraint.

### Journey 3 — Sending invoices 🟢 CLOSED

**Walked:** 21 April 2026  
**Findings:** 19 (J3-F1-F19) · **Fixed:** 14 across 4 commits · **Filed:** 5  
**Key commits:** `9b2e76f` · `7741084` · `9a62e33` · `bc6124d` (CRITICAL)  
**Notable:** **J3-F14a was a critical silent-data-lie bug** — bulk send flipped status without sending emails. Caught pre-customer. Bulk void now uses `void_invoice` RPC. Server-rendered preview removes duplicate HTML logic.

### Journey 4 — Managing existing invoice 🟢 CLOSED

**Walked:** 21-22 April 2026  
**Findings:** 29 (J4-F1-F29) · **Fixed:** 13 across 8 commits · **Filed:** 16  
**Key commits:** `3146b6b` · `73829f2` · `30cd45b` · `12fdcc4` · `cc8569c` · `d592c8f` · `78f2a40` (docs) · `1682abd` · `b381c4c` · `4000389` · `55169e3` (docs close)  
**Notable:** **J4-F24 was a critical silent-data-lie bug** — recalc failures after Stripe refunds left `invoice.paid_minor` stale and I1 ledger identity broken. Variant of J3-F14a. Closed with retry+audit helper, manual retry banner, and finance-team-safe RPCs avoiding audit_log RLS changes (Track 0.2 risk). Latent bug caught in `?action=refund` flow: first-payment check excluded fully-refunded first payments. Discoverability fix for paid-invoice header Refund button closes April 2026 QA feedback.

### Journey 5 — Refunds & disputes 🟢 CLOSED

**Walked:** 22 April 2026  
**Findings:** 27 (J5-F1-F27) · **Fixed:** 17 across 10 commits · **Filed:** 10  
**Key commits:** `77a1034` · `ca82742` · `88c2129` · `f82ade7` (Track A) · Track B: see git log for hashes  
**Notable:** Closed the Stripe webhook dispute handling production blocker. Three new webhook event handlers (charge.dispute.created/updated/closed), new payment_disputes table with finance-team RLS, lost-dispute compensating refund cascade via `apply_lost_dispute_cascade` RPC (status=succeeded with `refund_from_dispute_id` FK — `recalculate_invoice_paid` then naturally flips invoice paid→sent/overdue via A4). Dispute banner on InvoiceDetail, list flag, dashboard active-disputes card. Operator submits evidence via Stripe dashboard (no in-app evidence UI scoped in this journey). Track A refund hardening: DB-level SUM safety net on `validate_refund_amount` trigger, notification idempotency, webhook-path notification trigger for Stripe-Dashboard refunds, Stripe reason enum passthrough, `refund.updated/failed` handler for async reversal.

### Journey 6 — Payment plans (installments) 🟢 CLOSED

**Walked:** 23 April 2026  
**Findings:** 16 (J6-F1-F23, gaps included) · **Fixed:** 12 across 4 commits · **Filed:** 4  
**Key commits:** `ce05679` · `c2b2301` · `e63d6e8` · `767e12b` · docs close  
**Notable:** Payment plan removal now atomic via existing `cancel_payment_plan` RPC (previous client-side two-call path left partially_paid installments orphaned). Payment RPCs (`record_stripe_payment`, `record_payment_and_update_status`) now delegate status/paid_minor/overpayment/installment-cascade to `recalculate_invoice_paid` — single source of truth, A4 branch covered for both. Installment-overdue cron keeps its canonical time-based sent→overdue flip but additionally loops affected invoices through recalc so refund drift reconciles same-pass; partially_paid-past-due invoices included in the recalc set. Installment-upcoming reminder now computes real outstanding (not nominal) and falls back to student payer when no guardian. Auto-pay edge fn writes local audit trail (`auto_pay_initiated` / `auto_pay_failed`) independent of webhook delivery. PaymentPlansDashboard recognises partially_paid in health/overdue/next-attention computations and surfaces a "N partial" hint on the progress cell.

### Journey 7 — Reminders & overdue automation 🟢 CLOSED

**Walked:** 23 April 2026  
**Findings:** 24 (J7-F1-F25, see POLISH_NOTES — F25 added late during docs commit) · **Fixed:** 5 code + 2 docs across 6 commits · **Filed:** 15 (11 fix-later + 4 out-of-scope per brief)  
**Key commits:** `fab0b03f` · `14828a41` · `1dba1d8d` · `ef762451` · `5fde2b58` · docs close  
**Notable:** Exact-day-match cadence replaced with tier-aware "highest missing tier" gate — missed cron days no longer silently lose reminders. message_type taxonomy split into dynamic `${baseType}_d${tier}` suffix keyed to per-org `overdue_reminder_days` array. Student-payer fallback ported from J6 to the overdue surface. `invoice-overdue-check` gained the J6-F10 loop-and-recalc drift cleanup. `auto-pay-upcoming-reminder` email now shows outstanding (not nominal) to match what Stripe will actually charge. Dedup queries across all reminder crons now exclude `status='failed'` so failed sends retry.

### Journey 8 — Credits interaction with invoices 🟢 CLOSED

**Walked:** 24 April 2026  
**Findings:** 21 (J8-F1-F21) · **Fixed:** 5 code fixes across 4 commits · **Filed:** 11 (some non-bugs verified clean, see POLISH_NOTES)  
**Key commits:** `cfe0248` · `8ac1849` · `0442096` · `6360171` · docs close  
**Notable:** Closed a silent credit-resurrection path in `update_invoice_with_items` — the edit-draft flow missed the `voided_at` and `expired_at` guards that `create_invoice_with_items` and `redeem_make_up_credit` both have, meaning a voided credit could be re-applied via invoice edit. `delete_billing_run` now frees applied credits (previously orphaned them as unusable redeemed rows). `credit-expiry-warning` gained student-payer fallback and retry-unblocked dedup so failed Resend outages don't permanently consume the warning. New `issue_make_up_credit` RPC replaces the client-side non-atomic INSERT+audit pattern. `void_invoice` preserves original credit notes instead of overwriting. Minor polish: parent-portal SELECT drops always-null fields; IssueCreditModal expiry uses end-of-local-day (matches cron) and exposes the 90-day org-default option.

### Journey 9 — Recurring invoice templates 🟢 CLOSED (25 April 2026)

**Scope:** `recurring_invoice_templates` table + `RecurringBillingTab` UI + `useRecurringInvoiceTemplates` hook. Phase 0 walk (24 April 2026) confirmed ship-broken: UI fully built, zero backend (no scheduler, no generator, no child schema). Multi-phase rebuild scoped in design doc.

**Design doc:** `docs/RECURRING_BILLING_DESIGN.md` (v2 — decisions locked 24 April 2026).

**Phase 0 — Design (closed 24 April 2026).** Design doc committed; 10 locked decisions in §11.

**Phase 1 — Schema foundation (closed 24 April 2026).** 6 commits, all migrations. Extended `recurring_invoice_templates` with generator-contract columns; reconciled J9-F2 duplicate policy drift; new tables `recurring_template_recipients`, `recurring_template_items`, `recurring_template_runs`, `recurring_template_run_errors`; `invoices.generated_from_template_id`/`generated_from_run_id`; partial unique index on `invoice_items.linked_lesson_id` for DB-level duplicate-invoice defence; existing inert templates auto-paused. No runtime behaviour change.

**Phase 2 — Generator + manual run path (closed 24 April 2026).** 6 commits. `message_log.source` column + CIWI service-role bypass; `_shared/send-invoice-email-core.ts` extracted from existing send fn (behaviour-preserving refactor); `send-invoice-email-internal` service-role wrapper for the scheduler path; `generate_invoices_from_template` RPC with per-recipient savepoint isolation, weekly/monthly/termly period computation, payer + rate + item resolution chains, post-CIWI provenance UPDATE, and audit_log writes; `cancel_template_run` RPC for bulk void; Run-now UI on `RecurringBillingTab` with sequential auto-send via user-JWT path. Phase 1 schema fixes bundled into C4 (outcome CHECK, delivered_statuses default, run_errors.student_id NOT NULL drop).

**Phase 3 — Scheduler + notifications (closed 24 April 2026).** 4 commits. `recurring-billing-scheduler` edge fn registered on cron `0 4 * * *` UTC (cron-auth-gated, continue-on-error per template, draft-only auto-send for day-N+1 idempotency); `send-recurring-billing-alert` edge fn for partial/failed outcomes (finance-team recipients — owner + admin + finance, 5-min dedup on (template_id, run_id, outcome) triple); `message_log.source` CHECK extended for `'recurring_scheduler_alert'`. Phase 2 F1 cleanup: `as never` type assertions removed from `useRunRecurringTemplate.ts` post-types.ts regen. Observability via edge fn logs + alert emails (no separate `cron_run_log` table — intentional simplification).

**Phase 4A — UI operability gaps (closed 25 April 2026).** 5 commits. New hooks `useRecurringTemplateRecipients` (with org-wide count helper) + `useRecurringTemplateItems` issuing direct `supabase.from(...)` calls (RLS via `is_org_finance_team`; no new RPCs). `useCreateRecurringTemplate` / `useUpdateRecurringTemplate` extended for `term_id`. Three new controlled sub-components — `RecipientsField` (multi-select picker, paused-recipient restore, 'add all active' bulk), `ItemsField` (currency-aware amount entry; major→minor at save), `TermModeField` (Rolling vs One-shot radio). Wired into `RecurringBillingTab` dialog: hybrid `billing_mode` option exposed; canEdit broadened to include `finance` role (parity with backend `is_org_finance_team`); 'No recipients' destructive Badge on each TemplateCard. Inline validation (≥1 recipient when active; ≥1 valid item when upfront/hybrid; term required for one-shot termly). Recipient save uses upsert-flips-is-active-on-conflict; item save uses full-replace.

**Phase 4B — Operator UX polish (closed 25 April 2026).** 8 commits. `retry_failed_recipients` RPC + `parent_run_id` run linkage (reuses parent run's period; per-recipient savepoint algorithm mirrors the generator; `already_invoiced` new error_code for upfront/hybrid pre-check; template `last_run_id` preserved on fully-failed retry). Five new hooks backing the new surfaces: `useRecurringTemplateRuns` / `useRecurringTemplateRun` / `useRecentPartialOrFailedRuns` / `useCancelTemplateRun` / `useRetryFailedRecipients`. Two new pages: `/settings/recurring-billing/:templateId` canonical edit surface (Activate banner gates `active=true` behind validation; recipients/items/term-mode/runs in one page) and `/settings/recurring-billing/runs/:runId` with void and retry actions + friendly error_code labels + generated invoices table. Dashboard gets `RecurringRunsCard` (amber when partial-only, red when any failed, auto-hidden when zero); Settings tab gets `RecurringFailuresBanner` and click-through TemplateCards. Create dialog slimmed to basics; new templates default `active=false` so operator activates from detail page after adding prerequisites. UX refinements: student email in recipient picker, dedicated RotateCw restore icon on paused chips (no more click-anywhere misclick reactivation), CSS grid layout for items rows (no more lonely X button).

J9 now fully closed: schema, generator, scheduler, alerts, manual run, retry, void, detail surfaces, failure visibility.

### Journey 10 — Stripe auto-pay 🟡 IN PROGRESS

**Scope:** `stripe-auto-pay-installment`, off-session payment method usage, failure handling, customer notification, subscription-separate charge model.

**Phase 1 — Auto-pay capture, scope fix, reminders polish (closed 25 April 2026).** 5 commits + docs close. Webhook now persists `default_payment_method_id` on PI success (the authoritative single-write point — `setup_future_usage='off_session'` makes Stripe attach the PM, but the prior code path never read `paymentIntent.payment_method`). Service-role backfill RPC + driver edge fn for guardians who opted into auto-pay before the capture fix landed. Saved-PM list and detach moved off the connected account onto the platform — they were querying the wrong scope under any Connect-enabled org and silently returning empty. New 24-hour final reminder runs alongside the existing 3-day one (independent dedup), both now showing `${brand} ending ${last4} (expires MM/YYYY)` with a red expiry-warning block + "[Action needed]" subject prefix when the card expires before the charge date. Findings addressed: F1, F3, F5, F6. Filed: F2 (shared brand dictionary), F4 (backfill observability), F7 (charge-time failure-mode coverage).

**Phase 1 follow-ups:** Backfill driver run (operator-triggered, post-deploy). Charge-time failure-mode coverage (Phase 2).

### Journey 11 — Server-side PDF generation ⚪

**Scope:** Replace client-side jsPDF in `useInvoicePdf.ts` with an edge function using headless rendering (Puppeteer or equivalent). Branding-aware (org logo, brand/accent colors). Shared template between portal download, staff download, and invoice-email attachment (closes J3-F5). Likely ~1 session of work + a Lovable deploy for the edge function. Low coupling to other Journey 4 work — extracted during J4 walk because it's architectural, not polish.  
**Why extracted:** J3-F5 filed this as "PDF attachment on invoice emails". J4 walk confirmed the PDF itself is client-only, which means (a) no email attachment possible today, (b) any improvement has to move the renderer server-side first. One journey, not a patch.

### Filed for Area 1

- J4-F16 refund notification email fire-and-forget (J3-F4 class)
- J4-F17 RefundDialog success forced-close at 2.5s (polish)
- J4-F18 'cancelled' enum value dead references (enum cleanup)
- J4-F22 PDF audit_log write .then-chained not awaited (polish)
- J4-F25 orphaned pending refund rows accumulate on edge function crash (polish — cron cleanup)
- J4-F27 list Void on partially-paid hits A5 guard instead of pre-filter (polish)

## Known production blockers 🟠

Must be closed before any paid customer signs up:

1. ~~**Stripe webhook missing dispute handling** (Area 18 Journey 8) — chargebacks invisible. Real money loss.~~ **CLOSED** in Area 1 Journey 5, 22 April 2026. Three dispute event handlers landed, lost-cascade wired, operator notification + UI surfaces shipped. Area 18 Journey 8 now scoped to other missing events (`invoice.finalized`, `invoice.voided`, `payment_method.attached`, `customer.updated`) + broader webhook reliability.
2. **Audit log gaps on 14 business-critical tables** (Track 0.1) — money-adjacent data modifiable without trail.
3. ~~**Recurring invoice templates have no scheduler** (Area 1 Journey 9) — UI suggests feature works; no cron fires.~~ **CLOSED** by Journey 9 Phase 3, 24 April 2026. `recurring-billing-scheduler` edge fn + cron `0 4 * * *` UTC live; partial/failed runs trigger finance-team alerts.
4. **RLS walk not done** (Track 0.2) — March 2026 fix cluster suggests pressure; residual gaps likely.

## Scope decisions log

Recording decisions made during roadmap construction so future sessions understand why the structure is what it is.

- **21 April 2026:** 28 total areas (was 16 in original loose plan). Calendar split from lessons, term continuation split from terms, practice / notes / resources each split out, leads/CRM/booking merged into one area (they're the same user pipeline), subscription/trial split from settings, cross-cutting Area 0 added for invariants.
- **21 April 2026:** Audit log gap re-scoped after discovery found 14/19 tables (not "10 billing-adjacent" as initially noted) lack triggers. Elevated to production blocker.
- **21 April 2026:** Stripe dispute handling flagged as blocker after webhook event-list inspection.
- **21 April 2026:** Settings treated as 23 sub-journeys not 1 area. Each tab is its own polish pass.
- **21 April 2026 (Journey 4 walk):** Extracted server-side PDF generation from J3-F5 filed list into dedicated Journey 11 — it's an architectural rewrite, not polish. Unblocks invoice PDF email attachment.
- **22 April 2026 (Journey 4 close):** J4-F24 (silent recalc failure) closed via 3-attempt retry helper + audit_log trail + finance-team-safe read RPC + InvoiceDetail banner. Deliberately avoided relaxing audit_log SELECT RLS — narrow RPC approach keeps Track 0.2 risk surface unchanged.
- **22 April 2026 (Journey 5 close):** Dispute state surfaces via new `payment_disputes` table + UI banner + list flag, NOT via `invoice_status` enum extension. Kept enum blast radius at zero. Lost-dispute cascade uses existing `refunds` table with `refund_from_dispute_id` FK — `recalculate_invoice_paid` A4 path handles the invoice state flip naturally, no trigger or RPC changes to that function.
- **22 April 2026:** Journey 5 chose NOT to build in-app dispute evidence UI. Operator submits evidence via Stripe dashboard link surfaced in DisputeBanner. Keeps journey scope finite; evidence upload is a candidate for a later polish pass.
- **23 April 2026 (Journey 6 close):** Did NOT duplicate `cancel_payment_plan` — existing RPC already had the right semantics (locks + paid/partially_paid guard + atomic DELETE+UPDATE+audit). Pointed the hook at it instead of creating `remove_payment_plan`.
- **23 April 2026 (Journey 6, audit):** Kept the time-based `sent → overdue` flip in the `installment-overdue-check` cron rather than folding it into `recalculate_invoice_paid`. The helper's A4 branch covers refund-reopen only; a generic "time-aware" helper would widen its contract and affect every delegating RPC. Cron-only concern stays in the cron; recalc stays pure.
- **23 April 2026 (Journey 7 close):** Tier-reminder cadence uses dynamic `${baseType}_d${tier}` suffix keyed to per-org `overdue_reminder_days` array. Gate fires highest missing tier only — accepts that a long outage can skip a lower tier forever in favour of the escalated version. Urgency keyed to tier (friendly/important/urgent) not daysOverdue to prevent accidental tone flip on catch-up. No data backfill; accepts one-time deploy-day spike of ≤1 extra reminder per entity.
- **24 April 2026 (Journey 8 close):** Credit-apply eligibility checks unified across `create_invoice_with_items` / `update_invoice_with_items` / `redeem_make_up_credit` — all four guards (`voided_at`, `redeemed_at`, `expired_at`, `expires_at < CURRENT_DATE`) now present in every path. Edit-draft flow no longer a credit-resurrection hole.
- **24 April 2026 (Journey 8):** `delete_billing_run` extended to free applied credits. Prior semantics left redeemed-but-orphaned credit rows; no intent to leave them as tombstones. `voided_at IS NULL` guard on the UPDATE preserves the separate CRD-H4 invariant (a voided credit stays voided).
- **24 April 2026 (Journey 8):** IssueCreditModal expiry computed via `endOfDay()` to match the server-side auto-issue pattern. Credit-expiry cron and `redeem_make_up_credit` are timestamp-aware so no downstream trigger drift — the frontend change aligns UX with server behaviour.
