LessonLoop Billing & Invoicing Accuracy Forensics
Branch: audit/phase-2-billing-forensics
Purpose: Prove or break LessonLoop's billing correctness forensically.
Benchmark: "Could a teacher show this invoice to a parent, have the parent challenge the maths, and win?"
Section 1 — Three-path paid_minor consistency audit

Scope: every RPC that mutates `invoices.paid_minor`. Sources read:
- `supabase/migrations/20260401000000_auth_rls_hardening.sql` (latest definition of `record_payment_and_update_status`, plus REVOKEs on the other two)
- `supabase/migrations/20260331160001_record_stripe_payment_paid_guard.sql` (latest definition of `record_stripe_payment`)
- `supabase/migrations/20260316350000_payment_plans_phase1.sql:211-291` (definition of `record_installment_payment`)
- `supabase/migrations/20260316240000_fix_refund_audit_findings.sql:159-216` (latest `recalculate_invoice_paid`, 4th path)
- `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts:268, :677, :973` (callers + direct UPDATE path)
- `supabase/functions/stripe-auto-pay-installment/index.ts` (issues PI, does NOT call any RPC itself)
- `src/hooks/useInvoices.ts:335-391` (`useRecordPayment` → Path 1 caller)

Secondary write paths (mentioned for completeness, not scored as one of the 3 primary paths):
- `recalculate_invoice_paid` — called by the webhook post-refund (`stripe-webhook/index.ts:979`) and by `record_manual_refund` (`supabase/migrations/20260331160000_record_manual_refund_rpc.sql:74`). Writes `paid_minor` + status.
- Direct UPDATE in `stripe-webhook/index.ts:973` — on voided invoices during refund handling, bypasses all RPCs and writes `paid_minor` with no FOR UPDATE lock.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Path 1 — `record_payment_and_update_status` (manual admin payment)

- Definition: `supabase/migrations/20260401000000_auth_rls_hardening.sql:15-117`
- Caller: `src/hooks/useInvoices.ts:357` (`useRecordPayment` mutation, UI-driven)
- paid_minor mutation: line 96 — `UPDATE invoices SET paid_minor = _net_paid` where `_net_paid = SUM(payments.amount_minor) − SUM(refunds.amount_minor WHERE status='succeeded')`.
- Other fields mutated:
  - `invoices.status` → `'paid'` iff `_net_paid >= total_minor` (line 100). No other transitions.
  - INSERT into `payments` with `provider='manual'`, caller-supplied `method`, `currency_code`, `provider_reference` (line 67).
  - INSERT into `audit_log` (`action='payment_recorded'`, full context) (line 105).
  - Cascading greedy `invoice_installments` update: iterates installments by `installment_number ASC`, marks each `'paid'` while remaining payment ≥ installment amount (lines 71-89). Sets `paid_at`, `payment_id`, `updated_at`.
- Side-effects outside RPC: none from Postgres. Caller (`useInvoices.ts:372`) writes a client-side `audit_log` entry (DUPLICATE of the DB-side one) and invalidates React Query caches. No Xero sync, no email.
- Guards:
  - Auth: `is_org_finance_team(auth.uid(), _org_id)` required (line 42). Only path with an explicit in-body auth check.
  - Row lock: `FOR UPDATE` on the invoice (line 47).
  - Status gate: rejects `status IN ('paid','void')` with RAISE (line 50). NB: does NOT reject `'cancelled'`.
  - Over-application: RAISE if `_amount_minor > _outstanding` where `_outstanding = total − existing_paid + refunded` (lines 62-65). This is the ONLY path with an over-application guard.
  - Amount sign: neither positive-minimum nor non-negative check in RPC. Client hook enforces `> 0` and `<= 10_000_000` (`useInvoices.ts:348-352`).
  - Idempotency by provider_reference: NONE. A duplicate manual `provider_reference` is accepted and double-applied (subject to over-application guard).
- Error handling: any RAISE rolls back the full transaction including the payment INSERT and installment cascade.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Path 2 — `record_stripe_payment` (Stripe webhook: checkout.session.completed, payment_intent.succeeded)

- Definition: `supabase/migrations/20260331160001_record_stripe_payment_paid_guard.sql:7-134` (supersedes `20260316230000_atomic_record_stripe_payment.sql` by adding a `'paid'`-status skip).
- Callers: `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts:268` (checkout.session.completed) and `:677` (payment_intent.succeeded).
- paid_minor mutation: two write sites:
  - Idempotent branch: line 78 — `UPDATE invoices SET paid_minor = _net_paid, status = _new_status` (for duplicate `provider_reference`, ensures recalc is fresh).
  - Normal branch: line 124 — same shape after INSERT.
- Other fields mutated:
  - `invoices.status`:
    - → `'paid'` when `_net_paid >= total_minor`.
    - → `'sent'` when previous status was `'paid'` and `_net_paid < total_minor` (refund-aware REOPEN) — unique to this path (lines 71-76, 117-122).
    - Never touches `'void'`/`'cancelled'`.
  - INSERT into `payments` with HARD-CODED `method='card'`, `provider='stripe'`, `installment_id=_installment_id`, `paid_at=NOW()` (line 84). No `currency_code` set (relies on column default/NULL).
  - `invoice_installments`:
    - If `_pay_remaining=true`: blanket UPDATE of every pending/overdue installment → `'paid'` (lines 90-93). Does NOT set `payment_id`.
    - If `_installment_id IS NOT NULL`: UPDATE that installment → `'paid'` + set `stripe_payment_intent_id = _provider_reference` (lines 96-103). Does NOT set `payment_id`.
  - audit_log: NONE. No entry is written by this RPC.
- Side-effects outside RPC: caller (`stripe-webhook/index.ts`) dispatches a `payment_notifications` insert, renders a Resend email, and optionally posts to Xero — none of those are transactional with the paid_minor write.
- Guards:
  - Auth: NONE in function body. Protected only by `REVOKE EXECUTE … FROM authenticated/public` in `20260401000000_auth_rls_hardening.sql:318-319` (service-role bypass only).
  - Row lock: `FOR UPDATE` on the invoice (line 31).
  - Status gate: skips `status IN ('void','cancelled')` by returning `{skipped}` JSON (not a RAISE — caller sees success) (line 38); skips `status='paid'` with `{skipped}` JSON (line 47). NB: this means a legitimate partial top-up on an already-paid invoice is silently dropped.
  - Over-application: NONE. Accepts ANY `_amount_minor` without bounds-checking against outstanding balance.
  - Idempotency: YES — by `provider_reference` uniqueness lookup (lines 51-86). Duplicate returns the existing payment_id and re-runs the recalc (which may silently reopen status).
  - Amount sign: no check.
- Error handling: `RAISE EXCEPTION` only if the invoice is not found (line 34). Everything else returns JSON. The caller (`stripe-webhook/index.ts:277-280`) throws on `rpcError` to force a Stripe retry.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Path 3 — `record_installment_payment` (defined, but effectively ORPHANED)

- Definition: `supabase/migrations/20260316350000_payment_plans_phase1.sql:211-291`
- Callers: NONE in the repo. Searched `record_installment_payment` across all files: only the definition, the REVOKE in `20260401000000_auth_rls_hardening.sql:307-308`, and the generated type in `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts:6509`. `supabase/functions/stripe-auto-pay-installment/index.ts` creates a PaymentIntent and relies on the `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook to settle it via Path 2 (`stripe-auto-pay-installment/index.ts:134-137` — comment confirms "the webhook will handle recording the payment").
- paid_minor mutation: two write sites:
  - Fully-paid branch: line 276 — `UPDATE invoices SET paid_minor = _net_paid, status = 'paid'`.
  - Partial branch: line 279 — `UPDATE invoices SET paid_minor = _net_paid` (no status change).
- Other fields mutated:
  - `invoice_installments`: single row → `status='paid'`, `paid_at=NOW()`, optional `stripe_payment_intent_id = COALESCE(arg, existing)` (lines 252-256). Does NOT set `payment_id` (schema has the column; see Path 1 line 81).
  - `invoices.status`: → `'paid'` only when BOTH all installments paid AND `_net_paid >= total_minor` (line 275). Never reopens, never touches void/cancelled.
  - INSERT into `payments`: **NONE.** This is the critical defect — the function updates `paid_minor` using `SUM(payments.amount_minor)` (line 259) but never inserts the payment row itself. If this function were ever invoked, `_net_paid` would not include the amount just paid, so the installment would be marked `'paid'` while `paid_minor` under-counts by exactly that installment's amount.
  - audit_log: NONE.
- Side-effects outside RPC: none (no caller to add any).
- Guards:
  - Auth: NONE in function body. Protected only by REVOKE (`20260401000000_auth_rls_hardening.sql:307-308`, service-role bypass only).
  - Row lock: `FOR UPDATE` on both installment (line 231) and invoice (line 242).
  - Status gate: returns `{skipped}` JSON if invoice is `void/cancelled` (line 247); RAISEs if installment status not in `('pending','overdue')` (line 236).
  - Over-application: NONE. Accepts any `p_amount_minor` (though it's never actually inserted).
  - Idempotency by provider_reference/PI id: NONE — relies only on the installment status check.
- Error handling: RAISE for missing installment / parent invoice / non-payable status. Otherwise returns JSON.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Inconsistency register — intentional vs defect, with severity

1. **Path 3 never inserts into `payments`** (no caller today, but if ever invoked, `paid_minor` under-counts by the installment amount while the installment flips to `'paid'`). Defect. **CRITICAL.** Defined and callable by service role.
2. **Orphaned Path 3** — defined, REVOKEd, typed into `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`, but zero callers. Defect (dead code with a latent CRITICAL bug). **HIGH.**
3. **No over-application guard on P2 or P3** — a Stripe webhook replay with a tampered `amount` (or any service-role caller of P3) can push `paid_minor` above `total_minor`. Status flips to `'paid'` regardless. Defect. **HIGH.**
4. **No `audit_log` entry on P2 or P3** — parents challenging a Stripe-paid invoice have no DB-level trail (the UI hook writes one for P1 only). The webhook does write separate `refund_recorded` audit entries on refund (line 936ff) but NOT payment_recorded. Teacher-facing evidence gap. Defect. **HIGH.**
5. **Status-reopen only on P2** — P2 can transition `'paid'` → `'sent'` when a subsequent recalc shows net<total, but P1 RAISEs on `'paid'` and P3 never reopens. Creates divergent semantics for "same invoice, same net, different path". Intentional on P2 (baked into refund flow) but inconsistent. **MEDIUM.**
6. **Installment reconciliation strategies differ three ways** — P1 greedy-cascades by `installment_number`, P2 uses either `_installment_id` or a blanket flag, P3 updates one installment. An org that mixes manual + Stripe payments on a plan can end up with installments marked inconsistently vs. `paid_minor`. Intentional per-path, but no test covers the cross-path interaction. **MEDIUM.**
7. **Direct UPDATE path bypass** — `stripe-webhook/index.ts:973` writes `paid_minor` directly (void-invoice refund case) with no `FOR UPDATE` lock and no RPC. Race with concurrent refund/recalc possible. Defect. **MEDIUM.**
8. **`payments.currency_code` not set on P2 inserts** — P2's INSERT omits the column (line 84), so multi-currency orgs get `NULL` on Stripe payment rows while manual rows carry the code. Defect. **MEDIUM.**
9. **`invoice_installments.payment_id` only set by P1** — P2/P3 leave it NULL, so a teacher auditing "which payment settled which installment" has no link for Stripe-paid plans. Defect. **MEDIUM.**
10. **Cancelled-status handling differs** — P1 RAISEs on `'paid'` and `'void'` but silently accepts `'cancelled'` (line 50 only lists two states); P2 & P3 both skip void+cancelled. Defect on P1. **MEDIUM.**
11. **Return-shape divergence** — fields present differ across P1/P2/P3 (no `total_refunded` on P2/P3, no `payment_id` on P3). Intentional but makes a future unified caller fragile. **LOW.**
12. **Amount-sign check** — none of the three RPCs reject negative or zero amounts at the DB level; only P1's client hook enforces `>0`. A service-role caller could pass negative values. **LOW.**

Severity tally: 1 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 6 MEDIUM, 2 LOW.
